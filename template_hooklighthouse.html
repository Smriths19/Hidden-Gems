                <p class="px-5 text-justify">Hook lighthouse is one of the oldest lighthouses in the world and the second oldest operating lighthouse in Ireland. 

                    The existing structure dates back to the 12th structure although history claims that the initial structure was built in the 5th century by a missionary named St Rinn Dubhan. Another Gaelic word that sounds like Dubhan is “duan” which means “fish hook” and resulted in the lighthouse being locally referred to as the “Hook”.
                    
                    The first light keepers of the lighthouse were a group of monks who had a monastery at the Peninsula. In the 13th century they would put on fires to warn sailors of dangerous rocks on the peninsula.
                    
                    The hook lighthouse offers amazing views, mediaeval architecture, guided tour of mediaeval stories and light keeping.

                <p class="px-5 text-justify">
                    Hook lighthouse prioritises sustainable and eco-friendly tourism. They manage and reduce waste by recycling paper, tin, cardboard, clothes, aluminium, plastic, glass and paper.

                    Refreshments at the cafe are mainly from local Irish suppliers with a particular focus on limiting the amount of produce packaged in cling wrap and plastic.

                    The lighthouse is in an area known as Hook Head which is a special area of conservation as per the EU and Irish legislation.
